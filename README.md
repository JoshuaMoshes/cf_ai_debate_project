This project is an AI debate coach which you can provide with a topic and it will respond with the opposite of the side you are arguing for.

The code for the frontend can be found in the "web" folder and the backend is in the "worker" folder.


To test the app:
1. Input a prompt you want to debate.
2. Select Pro or Con and click "start debate".
3. Enter an argument for the side you chose and click "send".
4. Wait for the AI to respond and try to prove your point with more inputs.
